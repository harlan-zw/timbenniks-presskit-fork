<p class="text-xl mb-8 leading-relaxed">
  Masters of ceremonies, commonly called emcees, offer a profound value
  at conferences. As a seasoned emcee, I usually start with an anecdote
  as introduction, followed by an in-depth Q&A session that truly
  features the speakers and their content. Over the past few years, my
  emcee gigs have been largely virtual. Starting 2022, however, I've
  also acted as emcee at in-person conferences, such as Vuejs Amsterdam.
